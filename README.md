# Gavin Lee's vimrc settalment

This is [Gavin Lee's](https://github.com/calee0219) vimrc settalment.

Basically, I just used [amix's vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc).

I also add some [appending tool](append) to improve it

#### How to install
* First, type the command below in your termainal or cmd
```shell
git clone https://github.com/calee0219/vimrc.git ~/.vim
cd ~/.vim
```

* (On Linux) If you don't have python and pip or you're not sure what's this, type:
```shell
sudo apt-get install python python-pip
```

* (On Windows) Just go to [here](https://www.python.org/) to download and install python.

* Last, type:
```shell
chmod 755 ~/.vim/install_vimrc.sh
sudo ~/.vim/install_vimrc.sh
```
That's it!
